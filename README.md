This repository contains code for the research paper

**Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness of Recursive Utilities**

by Jaroslav Boroviƒçka and John Stachurski.

The paper is available [via arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06526).

Regarding the code, unfortunately we only have a Python version available at
this time.  Nonetheless, the code does reproduce all figures from the paper.

Figures and tables are reconstructed in Jupyter notebooks.  The whole
scientific Python stack can be downloaded as an integrated library 
[from Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  With that package installed the
Python code should run via the Jupyter notebook application.
