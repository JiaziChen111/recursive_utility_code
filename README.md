**Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness of Recursive Utilities**

by Jaroslav Boroviƒçka and John Stachurski.

The paper is available [via arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06526).

The code is written in Python and MATLAB.

In the case of Python, figures and tables are reconstructed in Jupyter
notebooks.  The whole scientific Python stack can be downloaded as a package
[here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  With that package installed the
Python code should run via the Jupyter notebook application.
