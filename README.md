**Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness of Recursive Utilities**

by Jaroslav Boroviƒçka and John Stachurski.

The paper is available [via arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06526).

The code is written in MATLAB, Python and Julia. 

The MATLAB and Python code is slower but also clearer and more stable.  (The only
issue with speed is that we need to recompute the stability coefficients at
many parameterizations.  This operation is highly
parallelizable but any such optimizations make the code less transparent and
less portable.  Hence we've stuck with the base implementation.)

In the case of MATLAB, execute the `run_*` files.  In the case of Python and
Julia, the figures are reconstructed in Jupyter notebooks.  If you navigate to the
`*.ipynb` files in the directories above you will be able to see them.

The whole scientific Python stack can be downloaded as a package
[here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  With that package installed the
Python code should run via the Jupyter notebook application.
