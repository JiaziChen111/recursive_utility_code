**Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness of Recursive Utilities**

by Jaroslav Boroviƒçka and John Stachurski.

The paper is available [via arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06526).

Unfortunately we only have a Python version available at this time.

Figures and tables are reconstructed in Jupyter notebooks.  The whole
scientific Python stack can be downloaded as an integrated library via
[here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  With that package installed the
Python code should run via the Jupyter notebook application.
